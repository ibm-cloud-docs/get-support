## How am I charged for support? 
{: #support-costs}
{: faq}

If you have Advanced or Premium support, you can track your monthly support costs. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Support costs**. Each support plan has a minimum monthly support price for your cloud workload at the stated service level. Beyond this starting price, any additional costs for support are based on your resource usage. The higher your resource usage, the higher your total support cost. 

Charges for support of third-party services are not included in the Advanced or Premium Support charge calculations. These non-IBM programs are licensed directly by their providers. 

To view your support costs, you need an access policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service. For more information about access roles, see [IAM access](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles).


## How can I upgrade my support plan?

{: #view-support-cases}
{: faq}

To access your support cases, in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Support** > **Manage cases**. If you're unable to view your cases, try clicking **View classic infrastructure cases**. 

If you still can't view them, you might not have the required permission. Ask your account owner to add you to the support case access group. For more information, see [SoftLayer account permissions](/docs/account?topic=account-migrated_permissions).
