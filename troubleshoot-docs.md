# Why isn't an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} docs page available?
{: #troubleshoot-docs}
{: troubleshoot}

If you go to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} docs page and the content doesn't display, try searching for the content instead to get you to the right place.
{: shortdesc}

You click a docs link, select a docs search result, or follow an existing bookmark to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} docs, and the following error is displayed.
{: tsSymptoms}

```
Sorry, this content isn't available.
The information you're looking for might have moved. Try searching the IBM Cloud Docs to find related content.
```
{: screen}

The page might have been moved or removed entirely, or the link itself might be incorrect.
{: tsCauses}

Search the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} docs to find related information.
{: tsResolve}

1. On the error page, click **Search in Docs** to go directly to the [IBM Cloud docs search](/docs/search).
1. Enter search terms for the topic that you're trying to find, and press Enter. For example, if the page was about configuring Kubernetes clusters, you might enter `config Kubernetes cluster`.
1. To search in the docs for a product or category of products, refine your search results by clicking the **Filter** icon ![Filter icon "Filter"](../icons/filter.svg), selecting the category or product, and clicking **Filter**.

If you still can't find the page that you were looking for, let the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} docs team know about the missing page by [submitting feedback](/docs/overview?topic=overview-feedback). In your feedback, include information about where you found the link to the missing page.
