# Viewing cloud status
{: #viewing-cloud-status}

The Status page is the central place to find details about all incidents, planned maintenance, announcements, and security bulletins about key events that affect the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} platform and services.

To get notified about key events that are specifically affecting your account, go to the [Notifications](https://{DomainName}/user/notifications) page. You can easily update your preferences there.

## Subscribing to an RSS feed
