# Data center migrations
{: #dc-closure}

As part of the data center modernization strategy for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, a data center is scheduled to consolidate.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} invests significantly in data center infrastructure. These investments include rolling out newer data centers and multizone regions (MZRs) designed to deliver a more resilient architecture with higher levels of network throughput and redundancy. For more information, see [Locations for resource deployment](/docs/overview?topic=overview-locations).

Part of this modernization strategy is to consolidate select data centers. As this transition approaches, help is available to assist you in your migration to modern data centers.
