# Escalating support cases
{: #escalation}

You can use the escalation process to surface critical issues and voice your concern about a support case. When a case is escalated, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support team reviews the information in the support case and responds with appropriate updates. For information about case severity, see [Case severity and initial response times](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-case-severity).

To escalate a case, complete the following steps:

1. Contact {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support using the options available for your support plan:
   * Advanced or Premium: Click **Chat with {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}** in the [Support Center](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external} to connect with a support agent or contact support by phone using the number in the [Support Center](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.
   * Basic: Add a comment in the support case requesting escalation
1. Provide your existing case number and a request to escalate the case.
1. Provide the justification an escalation and explain the business impact of your problem or issue.
