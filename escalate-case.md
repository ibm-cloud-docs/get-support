# Escalating support cases
{: #escalation}

You can use the escalation process to surface critical issues and voice your concern about a support case. When a case is escalated, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support team reviews the information in the support case and responds with appropriate updates. For information about case severity, see [Case severity and initial response times](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-case-severity).

To escalate a case, complete the following steps:

1. Contact {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support by phone or chat:
   * Pay-as-you-go or subscription accounts can contact support by phone and can find the number in the [Support Center](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.
   * Contact by chat from the [Support Center](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external} and click **Chat with {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}** from the Chat with a support agent tile.
1. Provide your existing case number and a request to escalate the case.
1. Provide the justification an escalation and explain the business impact of your problem or issue.

If your support inquiry requires a more immediate response, consider upgrading to the premium or advanced support plan so that you can open severity 1-4 support cases. To upgrade your support plan, contact a [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} representative.
