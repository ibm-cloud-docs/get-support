# Escalating support cases
{: #escalation}

You can use the escalation process to surface critical issues and voice your concern about a support case. When a case is escalated, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support team reviews the information in the support case and responds with appropriate updates. For information about case severity, see [Case severity and initial response times](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-case-severity).

To escalate a case, complete the following steps:

1. Contact {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support by phone or chat:
   * Contact by phone at the phone number listed in the [Support Center](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.
   * Contact by chat from the [Support Center](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external} and click **Chat with {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}** from the Chat with us tile.
1. Provide your existing case number and a request to escalate the case.
1. Provide the justification an escalation and explain the business impact of your problem or issue.

Basic support plans can access the technical support team only through cases. If your support inquiry requires a more immediate response, consider upgrading to the premium or advanced support plan so that you can open severity 1-4 support cases. To upgrade your support plan, contact a [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} representative.
