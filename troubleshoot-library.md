# Why don't I get results in the FAQ or tutorial library?
{: #troubleshoot-library}
{: troubleshoot}

If you filter for content in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} docs FAQs or tutorials libraries and don't get results, try searching the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} docs for related content.
{: shortdesc}

You filter for content in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} docs [FAQ library](/docs?tab=faqs) or [tutorials library](/docs?tab=tutorials) and see the following related message.
{: tsSymptoms}

In the FAQ library:
```
No FAQs found
It seems we can't find what you're looking for. Try updating your filter selections.
```
{: screen}

In the tutorials library:
```
No tutorials found
Sorry, there are no tutorials that match your criteria. Try updating your filter selections.
```
{: screen}

There might not be any content with your selected filters, or a topic might not be set with the correct filter value.
{: tsCauses}

Clear the selected filters, and try filtering the library again. If you still don't see any content, try searching all of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} docs for related content.
{: tsResolve}

   1. Go to the [IBM Cloud docs search](/docs/search).
   1. Enter search terms for the topic that you're trying to find, and press Enter. For example, if the page was about configuring Kubernetes clusters, you might enter `config Kubernetes cluster`.
   1. To search in the docs for a product or category of products, refine your search results by clicking the **Filter** icon ![Filter icon "Filter"](../icons/filter.svg) , selecting the category or product, and clicking **Filter**.

If you still can't find a tutorial or FAQ with information that you were looking for, let the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} docs team know about the missing page by [submitting feedback](/docs/overview?topic=overview-feedback).
